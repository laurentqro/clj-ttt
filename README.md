# Clojure Tic Tac Toe

The classic game of Tic Tac Toe, implemented in Clojure. It's the first time I write an application in a LISP, and found it enjoyable.

## Usage

To play against the AI, run `java -jar clj-ttt-1.0.0-standalone.jar`.

## Tests

To run the test suite, install Leingingen and run `lein spec`.
